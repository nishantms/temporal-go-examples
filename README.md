# Temporal Go Learning Examples

A comprehensive repository to learn Temporal.io with Go from zero to hero! ðŸš€

## What is Temporal?

Temporal is a durable execution system that allows you to write code as if failure doesn't exist. It:
- Automatically retries failed operations
- Handles timeouts and network issues
- Provides state management for long-running processes
- Enables complex workflow orchestration

Think of it as a way to write reliable, distributed applications without worrying about the complexity of failure handling.

## What is Go?

Go (Golang) is a programming language developed by Google. It's:
- Simple and easy to learn
- Fast and efficient
- Great for concurrent programming
- Perfect for building reliable services

## Prerequisites

### Installing Go (if not already installed)

1. **Ubuntu/Debian:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install golang-go
   ```

2. **macOS:**
   ```bash
   brew install go
   ```

3. **Windows:**
   Download from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/)

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

### Installing Temporal Server

You'll need a Temporal server running locally. The easiest way is with Docker:

1. **Install Docker** (if not installed):
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install docker.io`
   - macOS: Download Docker Desktop
   - Windows: Download Docker Desktop

2. **Run Temporal Server:**
   ```bash
   # Clone Temporal's docker-compose setup
   git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git temporal-docker
   cd temporal-docker
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access Temporal Web UI:**
   Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd temporal-go-examples
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start Temporal server:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-temporal.sh
   ```

3. **Run your first example:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd examples/01-hello-world
   go run worker/main.go
   
   # Terminal 2  
   cd examples/01-hello-world
   go run client/main.go
   ```

4. **See results:**
   - Check your terminal for output
   - Visit http://localhost:8080 for the Temporal Web UI

ðŸ“– **For detailed instructions, see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)**

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd temporal-go-examples
go mod tidy
```

### 2. Start Temporal Server

```bash
# Option 1: Use our helper script
./scripts/run-temporal.sh

# Option 2: Manual Docker setup
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git temporal-docker
cd temporal-docker
docker-compose up
```

### 3. Run Your First Example

```bash
# In one terminal - start the worker
cd examples/01-hello-world
go run worker/main.go

# In another terminal - start the workflow
go run client/main.go
```

## Learning Path

### ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level

1. **[Hello World](examples/01-hello-world/)** - Your first Temporal workflow
2. **[Activities](examples/02-activities/)** - Breaking work into activities

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level

3. **[Signals](examples/03-signals/)** - Communicating with running workflows
4. **[Error Handling](examples/04-error-handling/)** - Retry policies and error management

### ðŸ”´ Advanced Level

## Key Concepts Explained

### Workflow
A workflow is a sequence of steps that can be paused, resumed, and retried automatically. Think of it as a recipe that Temporal follows, even if some steps fail temporarily.

### Activity
An activity is a single unit of work within a workflow. Activities can fail and be retried independently. Examples: sending an email, calling an API, processing a file.

### Worker
A worker is a service that executes your workflows and activities. It polls Temporal for work to do.

### Task Queue
A named queue where workflows and activities are scheduled. Workers listen to specific task queues.

## Common Go Concepts You'll Need

### Structs
```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

### Interfaces
```go
type Worker interface {
    Start() error
    Stop()
}
```

### Goroutines (concurrent execution)
```go
go myFunction() // Runs in the background
```

### Channels (communication between goroutines)
```go
ch := make(chan string)
ch <- "message"    // Send
msg := <-ch        // Receive
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Build all examples
go build ./...

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Get dependencies
go mod tidy

# Update dependencies
go get -u ./...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Temporal server not running"**
   - Make sure Docker is running
   - Start Temporal server: `docker-compose up` in temporal-docker directory

2. **"Module not found"**
   - Run `go mod tidy` to download dependencies

3. **"Port already in use"**
   - Check if Temporal is already running: `docker ps`
   - Stop existing containers: `docker-compose down`
